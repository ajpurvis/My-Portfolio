            <h2>Raytheon Missiles and Defense</h2>
            <p>Since August 2020, I have been working as a Mechanical Engineer at Raytheon
               Missiles and Defense, primarily in a remote capacity. My role has allowed me 
               to work on a diverse range of weapons systems, and I have had the opportunity
                to develop simulations and models for cooling systems, preprocess datasets 
                for machine learning models using SQL, and communicate technical concepts to
                 shareholders. Additionally, I have built lasting relationships with 
                 suppliers, which has helped me to stay informed about the latest 
                 developments in the field and to better serve the needs of our customers. 
                 This experience has prepared me for other remote positions by giving me the
                  skills necessary to work independently and effectively communicate with 
                  team members and stakeholders remotely.</p>

            <h2>Pecan Property</h2>
            <p>As the manager of an LLC, I am responsible for overseeing a portfolio of three 
              properties and ensuring that their pricing strategy is optimized for maximum revenue. 
              I have utilized my expertise in data analysis and pricing strategy to develop a unique
               approach that combines the use of Airbnb's professional hosting tools and a third-party
                pricing software. This has allowed me to make data-driven decisions and fine-tune our
                 pricing strategy. I have also had the opportunity to conduct A/B testing on two 
                 identical units, providing valuable insights on the most effective pricing strategies.
                  Through my efforts, I have been able to streamline our business operations and bring
                   it to a mostly automated state despite the challenges posed by the ever-changing 
                   market conditions.</p>

            <h2>Program Manager</h2>
            <p>My role as a project manager at the University of Arizona VETS center has provided me with
               a diverse set of skills that have prepared me for a career in data engineering and machine
                learning. I have experience in tutoring and mentoring junior student veterans in engineering, 
                C++, MATLAB, physics, and math. Additionally, I have demonstrated leadership skills by successfully 
                leading a team of 7 veterans to return recovered dog tags from the Vietnam War to their families. 
                Furthermore, I have had the opportunity to work with large datasets and use modern investigative 
                tools to locate surviving veterans, which has allowed me to develop my data analysis and 
                problem-solving skills</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Project Engineer</h2>
            <p>My experience as a Project Engineer Intern at Honeywell Aerospace has prepared me for a career in
               data engineering and machine learning by giving me hands-on experience in project management and the
                integration of emerging technologies. During my internship, I was responsible for integrating emerging
                 technologies to advance solutions and improve project organization. Additionally, I developed a
                  technical and affordability project plan to install a communications interconnect system and 
                  collaborated with telephony system experts to address technical issues throughout system integration. 
                  These experiences have given me the ability to organize and manage projects effectively and to 
                  understand the importance of addressing technical issues early on, which will be valuable assets in 
                  a career in data engineering and machine learning.</p>

            <h2>US Marine Corps</h2>
            <p>With a background in military training and leadership, I have developed a strong foundation in data 
              analysis and project management. In my role as a Lead Water Survival Instructor for MCAS Miramar, 
              I coordinated and executed multiple training events per week, working closely with higher leadership
               to ensure appropriate resources were allocated. In my role as an Intermediate Ordnance Technician,
                I analyzed telemetry data, identified root causes, and implemented solutions to improve the performance
                 of a wide variety of weapons systems. Furthermore, I recommended and implemented lean processes to 
                 improve productivity and efficiency in maintenance practices. As a Junior Marine, I excelled in 
                 leadership positions and consistently achieved top marks in combat and technical training schools. 
                 These experiences have prepared me for a career in data engineering and machine learning as I have 
                 developed skills in data analysis, project management, leadership, and problem-solving.</p>

               effort to maintain and improve my coding skills. I have been using Codecademy
                Pro to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the field and to enhance
                my expertise in various coding languages. The platform offers a wide range of 
                courses that are tailored to my needs and interests, and I have had the opportunity
                to learn new skills and techniques that have helped me to become more proficient
                in my field. Through Codecademy Pro, I have been able to expand my knowledge base
